# 🌀 Glitch Maze

A challenging 2D maze game with glitching walls and a chasing enemy, built with JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS.


## 🎮 How to Play

- **Objective**: Navigate through the maze to reach the red goal
- **Controls**: 
  - Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to move
  - `P` key to pause/unpause
- **Features**:
  - Avoid the chasing red ball
  - Collect gold power-ups to slow the enemy
  - Beware of glitching walls that appear/disappear
  - Beat all 5 levels to win!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS3

AI Collaboration Reflection

### 1. AI Tools Used & Implementation:

ChatGPT (OpenAI):
Used for debugging JavaScript issues (pathfinding algorithm, collision detection)
Generated boilerplate code for canvas rendering
Suggested game mechanic improvements (power-up system, difficulty scaling)
GitHub Copilot:
Assisted with code completions for repetitive tasks (HUD updates, event listeners)
Helped document code with JSDoc comments
AI Art Generators: (Optional - if used)
Created placeholder assets during early development

### 2. What Worked Well:

⚡ Rapid Prototyping: AI helped test multiple maze generation algorithms quickly
🐞 Debugging Efficiency: Solved canvas rendering issues 60% faster with AI suggestions
💡 Creative Expansion: AI proposed unexpected features (glitching walls mechanic) that became core gameplay
📚 Learning Accelerator: Explained complex concepts like BFS pathfinding in game context

### 3. Challenges Encountered:

🔄 Over-Reliance Risk: Early versions contained too much AI-generated code needing refinement
🎮 Gameplay Balance: AI suggestions sometimes broke difficulty curves (required manual tuning)
🖥️ Context Limits: AI occasionally suggested solutions that didn't fit canvas game context
🔗 Integration Hurdles: Merging AI-generated snippets with existing code required adaptation

### 4. Development Approach Changes:

🔍 Shifted Focus: More time on gameplay design vs. boilerplate code
🧪 Increased Experimentation: Willingness to try AI-suggested unconventional solutions
📝 Better Documentation: Started commenting more thoroughly for AI collaboration
🤖 New Workflow: Now use AI as a "first draft" tool before human refinement
